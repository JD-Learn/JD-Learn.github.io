              <h2> Life is a Journey</h2>

              <p> We spend a lot of time hesitating and scared of what we should do next. So much that sometimes we don't
              even bother to take that next step. I think the hardest thing is to actually start. About four years ago,
              I found my self at a crossroads but the scariest thing finally became what would happen if I just kept going down the same path.
              Researchers suggest that people often say that the things they regret most are when they did nothing. So with that I bravely took the step forward.
              </p>

              <p> As I near the end of my journey at LCC International University, my time here has well exceeded my expectations.
                  Of course, it hasn't been easy and as a returning student there were many times when I honestly didn't want to
                  study anymore or write one more paper. Moreover, the pandemic put a huge damper on my motivation. However, somehow though
                  I have made it this far. I am really close to the end, and so I'm looking forward to what's next on the horizon and what the next chapter will bring.
