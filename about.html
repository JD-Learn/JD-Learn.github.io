              <h2>All About Me</h2>

              <p> I was born in Port au Prince, Haiti and then my family migrated to the United States.
                If I'm asked, I'm Haitian-American although I am a U.S. citizen. I speak English and Haitian Creole.
                The most important people in my life are my family, especially my sister and my nieces. I have a brother
                who is one of the funniest people I know and he also happens to be a super supportive person.

                <p>
                I grew up in the state of Georgia, specifically in East Atlanta and later on in Decatur. I lived on the
                west coast of the U.S. for a period of time, in the state of Washington. The Pacific Northwest is beautiful.
                You're surrounded by water, forests and mountains almost everywhere you go.
                I think it's probably the most beautiful place I've ever lived. For now I am in Klaipėda, LT until the summer.
              </p>

               <p>I'm introverted, but friendly. I am an advocate of seeking out professional help and hope to remove the stigma
                 seeking out mental health professionals for racial and ethnic minorities.
                 am interested in improving people's mental health and overall well-being.
                </p>


                <p>
                I'm a tennis enthusiast. When I'm back in the States I enjoy watching the Premier League on Saturdays and
                American Football on Sundays. Not to mention I am a tennis enthusiast, but don't ever ask me who my
                favorite player is.
              </p>


                <p>I love the sea and the sky. I enjoy taking walks through the forest, especially here in Klaipėda.</p>

                  <p>I can finally say I have lived abroad. For those not familar with the Baltics (Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia), it is truly a special place. Estonia is still on my list.
                    Regardless, I don't think I'll ever forget the time I've spent here in Lithuania and the wonderful friendships that I've made.
                  </p>

                  <p>As I move forward in the field of psychology, I realized I am mostly interested in topics related to:

                  <h2>Travel if you Can!</h2>
                  <p>It's an opportunity to visit new places, learn about new cultures to connect with people from all over the world.</p>
